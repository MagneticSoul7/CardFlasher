# CardFlasher
Online Flash card generator for studying. 

## Description 

This application lets a user create an online profile and login where they can create flashcard decks for studying. They can add as many cards as they want and write whatever they want on the fronts and backs of the cards, and they can also make multiple decks with different deck names. The application also has a feature where the user can click on a "shuffle" button to randomize the order of the cards in a deck for better studying. They can click "shuffle" as many times as they want to keep re-randomizing the order of the cards. The different flashcard decks will be saved to the user's profile so that the user can logout and then log back in at any time to see their decks again or study again.
